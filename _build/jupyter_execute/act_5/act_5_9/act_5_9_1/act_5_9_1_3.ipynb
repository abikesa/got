    "## 0 syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic structure or syntax of a Unix command is made up of several components. Here's a general breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Command Name**: This is the actual command you want to run, such as `ls`, `grep`, `awk`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Options**: These modify the behavior of the command. Options typically start with a dash (`-`) and can be either a single letter or a full word preceded by two dashes. For example, `-l` or `--long-option`. Options can change the way the command operates, enable or disable features, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Arguments**: These are the targets of the command, such as filenames, directories, or other input values. They come after the command and the options.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Redirection and Pipes**: You can also use symbols like `>`, `<`, `>>`, `|`, etc., to redirect input and output or to pipe the output of one command into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a general example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "command -option1 -option2 argument1 argument2 > outputfile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `command`: The name of the command to run.\n",
    "- `-option1` and `-option2`: Options that modify how the command behaves.\n",
    "- `argument1` and `argument2`: Arguments or operands the command will act upon.\n",
    "- `> outputfile`: Redirects the standard output of the command to a file called `outputfile`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that the specifics can vary quite a bit depending on the command, as different commands can have vastly different options and expected arguments. Always refer to the command's manual page (accessed by running `man command-name`) for detailed information on how a particular command should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "+ agent `user@mac dir $`\n",
    "+ verb `command` `-options`\n",
    "+ object `argument`\n",
    "\n",
    "> options are modifiers of the verb (adverbs if you will)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The double-dash `--` is often used in Unix command-line utilities to signify the end of command options. After `--`, any following arguments are treated as operands and not as options, even if they start with a dash `-`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `--`. Let's say you have a file named `-file.txt`, and you want to remove it using the `rm` command. If you try to remove it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rm -file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The command-line will interpret `-file.txt` as an option to the `rm` command and return an error since there's no such option.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you use `--`, you can tell the command that you're done with options, and everything after `--` is an operand:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rm -- -file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will successfully remove the file named `-file.txt`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Creating a new branch to overhaul the backend structure is a great way to experiment with changes without affecting the main branch. If you're satisfied with the new structure, you can merge it back into the main branch. Here's how you can do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ensure You're in the Right Directory**: Navigate to the directory where your local copy of the repository is located using a command-line interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fetch the Latest Changes**: Make sure your local copy is up to date with the remote repository by running:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   git pull origin main\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Replace `main` with the name of your default branch if it's not called \"main.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch where you can make your changes. You might call it something descriptive like \"new-backend.\" Run:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   git checkout -b new-backend\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Make Your Changes**: You can now start working on your new backend structure in this branch. Feel free to make any changes you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Commit Your Changes**: As you make changes, commit them to your branch with:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   git add .\n",
    "   git commit -m \"Description of the changes made\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Push the Branch**: If you want to push this branch to the remote repository (perhaps for backup or to share with others), run:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   git push origin new-backend\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Test Thoroughly**: Before merging the changes into the main branch, make sure to thoroughly test the new backend to ensure it works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Merge the Branch**: Once you're satisfied with the new backend structure, you can merge the branch back into the main branch. Here's how:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   git checkout main\n",
    "   git merge new-backend\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Push the Changes**: To update the remote repository with your new backend structure, run:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   git push origin main\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Clean Up**: If you want, you can delete the local branch now that it's been merged:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   git branch -d new-backend\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a branch, you're keeping all the history of your changes, and you have the flexibility to experiment without affecting the existing code. If something goes wrong, you can always switch back to the main branch, and your changes will be safe in the separate branch.\n",
